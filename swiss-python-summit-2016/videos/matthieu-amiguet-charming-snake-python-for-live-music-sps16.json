  "description": "\"At Les Chemins de Traverse we explore ways of \"augmenting\" acoustical musical instruments with new possibilities offered by computers. For doing so, we need ultra-low latency real-time audio processing programs. Pretty much the typical situation where python should *not* be used, right? Wrong. We've recently included python (with a strong use of Olivier B\u00e9langer's wonderful pyo module) in our set of tools for realizing the musical ideas we have in mind. This talk will expose why we came to consider python as a very interesting option for our realtime audio systems and how we use it on stage, with code and sound samples.\"\n\nTalk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 5th, 2016.\n\nLicensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.",
