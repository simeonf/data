  "description": "\"Have you ever been really annoyed about some APIs of open source libraries? There's are good reasons to be. Most libraries are devoted to backwards compatibility and are not able to change content anymore.\nComing from writing a Python library called \"Jedi\", I can feel with you. I have hated my own APIs more than enough. I have learned the hard way and want to tell you a few things I would have loved to hear years earlier!\"\n\nTalk recorded at the Swiss Python Summit on February 5th, 2016.\n\nLicensed as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.",
