Maybe you feel the human connection is marketing\u2019s job, or if you\u2019re in a highly technical field, maybe you think your users are smart enough to make the connections themselves. Maybe you have so much work, it\u2019s all you can do to write something technically accurate before moving on to the next update. The result can be documentation that is airless, academic, and overly technical. In other words, not something that users would want to read! If the success of your company depends on your users actually using your documentation, you have to engage them and build understanding.\r\nThis presentation will discuss how to create documentation that engages readers and focuses them on what matters. Using the writing process developed by Peter Elbow, author of \u201cWriting without Teachers,\u201d I\u2019ll show how to conduct peer reviews that elicit the reader\u2019s subjective experience -- what Peter Elbow called \u201cmovies of the reader\u2019s mind\u201d -- to reveal the ambiguities that can plague our writing. We\u2019ll look at how to use the &quot;summary and sayback&quot; and \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d techniques to help writers distill a technical passage down to its core. We\u2019ll also look at how giving your documentation a more human voice can improve not only the reader\u2019s experience, but your own experience as a writer as well!",
