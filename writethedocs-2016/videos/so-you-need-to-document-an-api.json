How should you present the endpoint reference? What sorts of conceptual information are developers be looking for? Where to start?\r\nThis talk provides the answers to these questions! We\u2019ll go through organizational strategies for API docs and discuss ways to handle the reference, tutorial, and conceptual material you might need to produce. Throughout, we\u2019ll focus on thinking about what the end users need and building the docs to support those goals. We\u2019ll also look at modern tools that can make your API documentation useful, usable, and snazzy-looking, and talk about strategies for documenting APIs when you\u2019re stuck with a publishing tool that might not be ideal for the task (Madcap Flare, for example).",
