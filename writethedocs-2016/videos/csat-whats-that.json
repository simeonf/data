But how do you do that when your audience is incredibly specialized? What if the information you\u2019re presenting is rapidly changing? How can you be certain that your documentation is always relevant for that audience?\r\nTo answer all those questions, at New Relic we use CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) data. Our Docs team monitors CSAT comments and data for every single public-facing doc we own. We use that data to make dynamic decisions that affect our site and our docs work, influencing everything from quick doc fixes, giant rewrites, and our own site\u2019s functionality.\r\nEvery pertinent comment receives attention from at least one tech writer. Part of our code example is out of date? Fixed. There\u2019s a glitch on our site? We\u2019ll look into it. We list a version of Mongo that\u2019s outdated? Updated. By focusing on these comments, your audience is working with you to keep your documentation updated.\r\nWhat happens when a customer doesn\u2019t leave a comment, and just says the document wasn\u2019t helpful? We track that too. When docs have consistently negative feedback without constructive comments, we know that at least something in that doc needs work. When that happens, we work with SMEs to rewrite those docs and give them a little love. We polish \u2018em up and publish them again, tracking their data afterwards to make sure that they\u2019re indeed improved.\r\nAnd this doesn\u2019t just benefit the Docs team. We\u2019ve forwarded UI complaints to design, and disgruntled customer comments to Support. That\u2019s part of the beauty of CSAT: it\u2019s a direct line to all the customers looking for help with our products. With CSAT, our audience is helping us to curate the best possible information for all their needs.\r\nBut we\u2019re not stopping there. Soon, we\u2019ll be implementing OAuth for our CSAT data. Once that\u2019s enabled, we\u2019ll be able to see what specific products customers are using, what region they\u2019re in, what type of user permissions they have, and a ton of other stuff. We\u2019ll be positively swimming in audience connectedness from our CSAT, and with it, we\u2019ll know that our audience is understanding our concise information in the best way possible.",
