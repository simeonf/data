In this talk, you\u2019ll learn to put together a README that makes a great impression, even if you have little time or writing skills.\r\nAt the top of your directory tree, your README is your software\u2019s resume: it\u2019s often the first and\u2014if you\u2019re not careful\u2014the last thing anyone sees of your software. But you may not have time to craft a bespoke README. That\u2019s OK! In this talk, you\u2019ll learn:\r\nwhy it\u2019s important to have a great README, whether you\u2019re working on a closed- or open-source project\r\nhow to choose what to write first to get the best README in the shortest time\r\nhow to use templates and Mad Libs to avoid common README pitfalls\r\nFrom your project\u2019s name to what\u2019s in that LICENSE file, you\u2019ll learn what to write first and what mistakes to avoid, so that your README wows new users, helps colleagues or contributors, and maybe even does your future self a favor.\r\nLike Mike Jang\u2019s Ignite OSCON 2015 talk \u201cTen Steps to a Better README\u201d1, this talk will recommend style and content, but with a greater focus on the process of writing a README. While inspired by open-source approaches to READMEs\u2014including readings of style guides such as 18F\u2019s \u201cMaking READMEs Readable\u201d2 and the READMEs of all projects that have 10,000 or more stars on GitHub\u2014this talk will not be limited to the context of open source.\r\nWhether you&#39;re new to the genre or a README connoisseur, you&#39;ll learn a process to write a README that works for you and your audience.",
