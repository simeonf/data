Both documentation and customer support are critical to the success of any company, and they work better when they assist and improve each other. How can tap the knowledge of our support agents to improve the documentation, and how can we make the lives of support agents easier in return?\r\nI\u2019ve worked very closely with customer support and customer success teams for years, and I\u2019ve gone from thinking of them as \u201cthe RTFM, turn if off an on again folks\u201d to being their biggest advocate and fan.\r\nLet me tell you how documentarians can work with customer support to turn the F in RTFM from F*** to FANTASTIC!\r\nHow does a documentarian work with customer support?\r\nReview support tickets manually\r\nSet up automated notifications\r\nReview difficult cases and solutions with customer support agents\r\nLearn about your customers\r\nReview ticket metrics, and measure how they change as you add more documentation\r\nHave them write!",
