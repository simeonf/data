Create a living knowledge base that people want to use 2. Switch from just-in-case documentation to just-in-time documentation\r\nIn order to start churning out content, I designed a workflow process called Just-\u00adIn-\u00adTime (JIT) documentation. Just In Time is actually a production strategy that is used primarily in manufacturing, to cost-\u00adeffectively manage inventory supply. Some say that the approach originated in Japan, others credit Henry Ford. As we applied it to documentation, just-\u00adin-\u00adtime means that we create the just enough documentation, just in time. This presentation covers how we created this process, how we\u2019ve refined it and its success.",
